# Including CSS/JS Minification, logger and other things

### Add JS and CSS files on models/minification.py.

Actually there are :

    js_files = [
        URL('static', 'js/jquery-1.5.2.js'),
        URL('static', 'js/main.js')
        ]
    css_files = [
        URL('static', 'css/base.css')
        ]

An example of working inclusion is in views/layouts/layout.html :

    {{# Js files are included from db/minification.py }}
    {{for _item in js_files or []:}}
    <script src="{{=_item}}"></script>
    {{pass}}

    {{# Css files}}
    {{for _item in css_files:}}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{=_item}}">
    {{pass}}


### To differenciate a production environ there is an environ variable to set

export PRODUCTION='True'
